My name is Rachel Torres and I'm a doctoral candidate at the University of Iowa in the Department of Political Science. I graduated from the University of North Texas with a B.A. in Political Science in 2016, and was previously a McNair Scholar. I am currently a Ballard and Seashore Fellowship Recipent for the Fall 2020 semester.

My dissertation examines how local policy interacts with federal immigration enforcement, and the impact of this interaction on both foreign and native-born Latino political attitudes and behavior. I intend to defend my dissertation in the Spring of 2021.
