Abstract: 

There is an emerging debate over whether campaign donations influence legislative behavior through an
exchange of goods or if campaign donations, as Mayhew (1974) suggests, serve as a reward for taking
positions on policy. We take the latter position by arguing that interest groups are more likely to reward
House members who take up positions that are out of sync with their ideological or partisan preferences –
because the cost to these legislators requires a higher reward. To test our argument, we rely on an original
dataset that examines the relationship between an untested form of position taking –bill cosponsorship
of punitive immigration legislation –and Political Action Committee (PACs) contributions from three of
the largest private prison companies in the U.S. We find strong support for our expectations even after
accounting for possible endogeneity. While there is a link between bill cosponsorship and campaign contributions, private prison companies are more likely to reward House Democrats who co-sponsor punitive
immigration policies. The findings have important implications regarding the symbiotic relationship between
House members and private interests. House members, and House Democrats more specifically, can use cosponsored bills as a low-cost tool to effectively attract campaign donations. Meanwhile, private
interests, such as the private prison corporations, can further expand their operations into immigrant
detention and generate revenue at the expense of undocumented immigrants. 

This project was jointly presented at the 2019 Western Political Science Association annual meeting.
